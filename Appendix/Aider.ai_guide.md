# Aider AI Tool - Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction
Aider is an AI-powered pair programming tool that integrates with your local git repository. It allows developers to collaborate with Large Language Models (LLMs) to edit and improve code efficiently. Aider supports models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek V3, o1, and GPT-4o.

## Prerequisites
Before using Aider, ensure you have the following:
- A stable internet connection
- A local git repository
- Python installed (version 3.8+ recommended)
- Access to an API key for your preferred LLM (if applicable)

## Step 1: Install Aider
1. Open a terminal window.
2. Install Aider using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install aider
   ```
3. Verify the installation:
   ```sh
   aider --version
   ```

## Step 2: Set Up Your Git Repository
1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
2. Ensure git is initialized:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```
3. (Optional) Connect to a remote repository:
   ```sh
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   ```

## Step 3: Start Aider
1. Run Aider in your terminal:
   ```sh
   aider
   ```
2. If prompted, enter your API key for the LLM service.
3. Aider will start a session and allow you to enter commands for code modifications.

## Step 4: Edit Code Using Aider
1. Open an existing file for modification:
   ```sh
   aider your_script.py
   ```
2. Describe the changes you want to make (e.g., "Refactor this function for better readability").
3. Aider will suggest changes; you can accept or modify them as needed.

## Step 5: Review and Commit Changes
1. Review changes made by Aider:
   ```sh
   git diff
   ```
2. If satisfied, stage and commit changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Refactored code with Aider AI"
   ```
3. (Optional) Push changes to your remote repository:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

## Step 6: Advanced Features
- **Multi-file editing:** Open multiple files in a single Aider session.
- **Automated debugging:** Describe an issue, and Aider can suggest fixes.
- **Code documentation:** Ask Aider to generate docstrings for functions.

## Step 7: Troubleshooting
1. If Aider isn't working as expected, check logs:
   ```sh
   aider --debug
   ```
2. Ensure your API key is correct and active.
3. Verify that your git repository is properly set up.

## Conclusion
Aider AI is a powerful assistant for pair programming and code collaboration. By integrating it into your workflow, you can streamline coding tasks, improve code quality, and accelerate development.
